This repository contains a growing selection of Arduino code examples to use with the Farming Simulator Telemetry Application in conjunction with the Farming Simulator Telemetry Mod.

Most (not necessarily all) code examples will come in both a Serial connection and a Wifi connection flavour. These are mostly intended to give you a starting point to develop and build your own hardware to use with Farming Simulator.

See https://www.youtube.com/@upsidedownLS13 for demonstrations, explanations and upcoming projects.
